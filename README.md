## My process

### Built with

plain JS,CSS and HTML, mobile first, using only flexbox.

### What I learned

I tried this one approaching mobile first but using just flexbox, was quite a challenge and it took me more than expected.
I had to research to style the slider part correctly. The responsive design was more challenging than the JS part (because i didn't know flexbox quite well yet), i also struggled a little with the toggler button, wasn't that hard to program it anyway. Looking forward to more challenges! 

### Continued development

Have to make this responsive design thing click on me, also i would like to try a CSS methodology to structure more my code -and maybe reduce it-
